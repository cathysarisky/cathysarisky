Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cathy Sarisky, a certified Ghost Expert.  

I'm a freelancer/sole proprietor of [Spectral Web Services](https://www.spectralwebservices.com).  

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) is my jam, and your [support](https://github.com/sponsors/cathysarisky) helps me have more time to fix bugs, make bits of the Ghost UI translatable, add wanted features, and otherwise do awesome stuff.
